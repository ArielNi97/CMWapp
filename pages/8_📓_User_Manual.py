- Click on the **Walls Material Page**.
- Adjust the Masonry compressive strength by using the slider (ranging from 45 $kg/cm^2$ to 55 $kg/cm^2$).
- Choose the compressive strength at 28 days from the available options (210 $kg/cm^2$ or 245 $kg/cm^2$).
- Select the Steel yielding stress for Reinforcement Bars from the options (4200 $kg/cm^2$ or 2800 $kg/cm^2$).
- Download the Input File Template for reinforcement Bars by clicking the '**Download Input File Template**' button.
- Open the file in your local Downloads folder.
- The file consists of two columns: Wall Label and Rebars.
- Wall labels start with "W" followed by ascending numbers.
- Vertical reinforcement bars for each confined tie-column are listed under the **Rebars** header.
- The first number indicates the quantity of bars for each column, followed by a hashtag and another number representing the bar type (e.g., "#4" for 4/8" diameter).
- Customize the input file by adding, removing, or editing walls and reinforcement bars as needed.
- Wall labels are crucial for identifying walls in the results.
- Rebar quantities are limited to 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and types range from #3 to #8.
- Ensure that the arrangement of rebars does not exceed 8#8 in total steel reinforcement area.
- Save the edited input file locally and upload it by dragging and dropping it onto the cloud icon. Alternatively, use the '**Browse Files**' button.
- Double-check the rebar information in the chart displayed after the file upload; if it's incorrect, try uploading it again.

- Access the **Walls Analysis Page** to view the results.
- This page includes six tabs, with the Axial Load Capacity (ALC) of the walls displayed by default.
- Two plots are shown: one depicting Axial Load Capacities of Walls and another displaying Axial Load Capacities vs. Demands.
- The first graphic shows wall labels on the x-axis and related axial capacities in kg on the y-axis, with colors and sizes indicating wall lengths. Hover over points for more information.
- The second graphic displays axial load demands on the x-axis and related axial capacities on the y-axis. The diagonal line represents a limit where the Demand-Capacity Ratio (DCR) should not exceed 1, indicating compliance with the code. Walls below the diagonal line may not meet code requirements. Colors are based on wall labels.
- Download data in CSV format by clicking the '**Download Data in CSV Format**' button or save plots as images by right-clicking on the graphics.
- Expand both graphics to fullscreen mode by clicking the '**View Fullscreen**' icon at the top right.
- Switch to the Pure Bending Capacities of Walls (PBC) tab to view bending results with similar features.
- The Axial-Bending Capacity of Walls (ABC) tab displays an interaction between axial and bending capacities, allowing filtering by wall labels.
- The In Plane Shear Walls Capacities (INPSC) tab provides two graphics with corresponding data download options.
- The Out of Plane Stress Capacities (OOPSC) tab displays three graphics based on wall location: first floor, any floor, and highest floor. Download data for each with the provided buttons.
- Explore the Backbone Curve (BBC) tab, offering a tri-linear model to explain confined masonry walls' non-linear behavior. Utilize the same options as the ABC tab.
