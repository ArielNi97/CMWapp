- This app is intended to be used by Structural Engineers, Builders, 
or architects.
- It only calculates the Confined Masonry Walls capacities. Other type 
of similar walls, such as reinforced Masonry Walls, Unreinforced Masonry 
Walls, or masonry infill walls are out of the scope of this app.
- The Axial-Bending, Pure bending, Combined axial-bending and Back Bone
curve are obtained by a Machine Learning model trained and validated with 
more than 3 Million walls varying its geometrical and material
properties complying with the Nicaragua MP-001 standard and the
trilinear Shear-drift curves were calculated based on the
research made by borah, Kaushik and Singhal, in 2022, “Lateral load-deformation
models for seismic analysis and
performance-based design of confined masonry walls”.
- Several Machine Learning Models were perfomed (Decision Trees, 
Random Forest,XG boost, Adaptive Boosting, KN-Neighbors, Light 
gradient boosting, categorical boosting), however the chosen one 
to predict the capacities, was categorical boosting since it was 
the more accurate among them all.
- Out of plane wall capacities are calculated via python scripts 
and based in Peruvian code (E070, 2019).
- The data base was made combining different parameters of walls,
such as: Wall Length, Wall Height, Wall thickness, column width, 
number and type of rebars,  Masonry compressive strength, Concrete 
compressive strength, Steel yielding strength.
- The interface of this app is made using streamlit.
- The deployment was made with render.io.
- The user inputs are limited to Project Location, Wall Loads, 
Walls Geometry, Walls Material and Walls Boundary Conditions.
- The outputs are limited to the information displayed in the Analysis 
Tab.

- In material properties the user only can define the compressive 
masonry strength, concrete compressive strength, steel yielding strength
and upload a bar type file.
- A range from 45 to 55 kg/cm2 can be selected for compressive masonry
strength.
- Only two types of compressive concrete strength can be selected, 210
and 245 kg/cm2.
- Same as above, only two types of steel yielding strength can be
selected 2800 and 4200 kg/cm2.
- The input of bar types is set by 2 columns, the first one must have
a column called literally Wall Label, and the user has the freedom 
two use any identifier for the walls. For instance, the Wall Label 
that the author propose is using Wn, where W means Wall and n varies 
in an ascendant order, starting from 0 to the total number of walls. 
For instance, W1, W2, W3…Wn. In case of the second column, it must 
be named “Rebars” literally, the user can add the quantity and type of 
bars (Q#T) where Q is the quantity of bars and T is the type of bars, 
for instance the user can specify a 4#4 arrangement, or a 12#6 
arrangement.
- The columns names must not be changed by the user for the Rebars
input uploaded to the app.
- The user must respect the format of the rebars arrangement, other
style must be avoided. For instance, 12N°4 is unacceptable.
- The user can only choose between #3 to #8 bars, and a combination
of arrangements that makes no more than 40 cm2. Arrangements with
higher arrangement may give unprecise results.
- The number of rows in the input rebars file need to be consistent
with the number of rows and columns. The user always needs to make
sure that every row is filled with desire values.
- Unexperienced user should download the available template file
that will help to build the final input rebars file.
- The Rebars are read by the algorithms per each column. 
- Masonry units are based only in concrete units, other materials 
like clay bricks or Local Stones are not part of the scope of this app.

Different Walls lengths may give wrong outputs.

rectangular sections may lead towards wrong output.

  of the intermediate confined beam. Therefore, the 'h' in equation 8.1

  - For In-Plane Shear Capacity, we utilize a conservative approach,
